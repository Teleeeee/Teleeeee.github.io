      <h3>Dolphins</h3>
      <p>
          They are found worldwide, mostly in shallow seas of the continental shelves,
          and are carnivores, mostly eating fish and squid. Dolphin coloration varies,
          but they are generally gray in color with darker backs than the rest of their
          bodies.

      <h3>Elepants</h3>   
        <p>    Elephants, the largest existing land animals, are mammals of the family Elephantidae.
            Three species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest
            elephant, and the Asian elephant. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order
            Proboscidea; extinct members include the mastodons. The family Elephantidae also contains
            several now-extinct groups, including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants.
